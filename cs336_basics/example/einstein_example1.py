# Batched matrix multiplication with einops.einsum
import torch
from einops import rearrange, einsum
## Basic implementation
Y = D @ A.T
# Hard to tell the input and output shapes and what they mean.
# What shapes can D and A have, and do any of these have unexpected behavior?
## Einsum is self-documenting and robust
#
                          D                A     ->          Y
Y = einsum(D, A, "batch sequence d_in, d_out d_in -> batch sequence d_out")
## Or, a batched version where D can have any leading dimensions but A is constrained.
Y = einsum(D, A, "... d_in, d_out d_in -> ... d_out")
