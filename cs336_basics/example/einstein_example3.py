# Pixel mixing with einops.rearrange
# Suppose we have a batch of images represented as a tensor of shape (batch, height, width, 
# channel), and we want to perform a linear transformation across all pixels of the image, but this 
# transformation should happen independently for each channel. Our linear transformation is 
# represented as a matrix 𝐵 of shape (height * width, height * width).
channels_last = torch.randn(64, 32, 32, 3)  # (batch, height, width, channel)
B = torch.randn(32*32, 32*32)
## Rearrange an image tensor for mixing across all pixels
channels_last_flat = channels_last.view(-1, channels_last.size(1) * channels_last.size(2), channels_last.size(3)) 
channels_first_flat = channels_last_flat.transpose(1, 2)
channels_first_flat_transformed = channels_first_flat @ B.T
channels_last_flat_transformed = channels_first_flat_transformed.transpose(1, 2)
channels_last_transformed = channels_last_flat_transformed.view(*channels_last.shape)
# Instead, using einops:
height = width = 32
## Rearrange replaces clunky torch view + transpose
channels_first = rearrange(
    channels_last,
    "batch height width channel -> batch channel (height width)"
)
channels_first_transformed = einsum(
    channels_first, B,
    "batch channel pixel_in, pixel_out pixel_in -> batch channel pixel_out"
)
channels_last_transformed = rearrange(
    channels_first_transformed,
    "batch channel (height width) -> batch height width channel",
    height=height, width=width
)
# Or, if you’re feeling crazy: all in one go using einx.dot (einx equivalent of einops.einsum)
height = width = 32
channels_last_transformed = einx.dot(
    "batch row_in col_in channel, (row_out col_out) (row_in col_in)"
    "-> batch row_out col_out channel",
    channels_last, B,
    col_in=width, col_out=width
)
# The first implementation here could be improved by placing comments before and after 
# to indicate what the input and output shapes are, but this is clunky and susceptible to bugs. 
# With einsum notation, documentation is implementation!
